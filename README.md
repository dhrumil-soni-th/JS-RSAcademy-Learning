  - `if-else` conditions.
  - `while` and `do-while` loops.
  - Using `for` loops to find common multiples of numbers.
  - Demonstrates boolean logic and loop termination.

---

### 3. `basics3.js`

- Focuses on array operations:
  - Creating arrays using different methods.
  - Array slicing, accessing, and modifying elements.
  - Using array methods like `push`, `pop`, `unshift`, and `indexOf`.
  - Demonstrates `reduce`, `filter`, and `map` methods for array transformations.
  - Sorting and reversing arrays.
  - Includes practical examples like summing array elements and filtering even numbers.

---

### 4. `basics4.js`

- Explains variable scopes and functions:
  - Differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
  - Demonstrates block-level and functional scoping.
  - Show examples of named and anonymous functions.
  - Introduces arrow functions for concise syntax.

---

### 5. `basics5.js`

- Demonstrates string operations:
  - Calculating string length, slicing, and splitting.
  - Parsing and manipulating numeric strings.
  - Concatenating strings and finding substrings.
  - Counting occurrences of a substring in a string.
  - Includes an example of using a custom `Person` class.

---

### 6. `basics6.js`

- Introduces JavaScript objects:
  - Creating and accessing object properties.
  - Adding, updating, and deleting properties.
  - Checking for the existence of properties using the `in` operator.
  - Iterating over object properties using a `for-in` loop.

---

### 7. `basics7.js`

- Demonstrates JavaScript classes:
  - Creating a class with properties and methods.
  - Using a constructor to initialize class instances.
  - Defining getters for computed properties.
  - Includes an example of a `Person` class with a `fullName` method.

---

### 8. `basics8.js`

- Explains inheritance in JavaScript:
  - Demonstrates how one class can inherit properties and methods from another.
  - Shows how to override parent class methods in a subclass.
  - Uses the `super` keyword to call the parent class constructor.
  - Includes an example of a `Pet` class inheriting from the `Person` class.

---

### 9. `Assignment1.js`

- Solves a practical problem using arrays:
  - Calculates the total of an array of expenses.
  - Finds the highest and lowest expenses using `reduce` and `Math.max`/`Math.min`.
  - Demonstrates alternative approaches using loops.
